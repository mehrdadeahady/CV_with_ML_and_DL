"CNN in DL" refers to the role and application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the field of Deep Learning (DL).
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural network architecture, widely used in deep learning, 
particularly for tasks involving visual data. 
They are designed to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input data, making them highly effective for image and video processing.
Key aspects of CNNs in Deep Learning:

    Feature Extraction:
    CNNs utilize convolutional layers with filters (or kernels) to detect patterns and features within data, such as edges, shapes, and textures in images. 
    This process of automatic feature extraction is a significant advantage over traditional methods that require manual feature engineering.
    Hierarchical Learning:
    CNNs learn features in a hierarchical manner. Early layers typically identify basic features, 
    while deeper layers combine these basic features to recognize more complex patterns, like objects or faces.
    Parameter Sharing:
    CNNs employ parameter sharing through the use of filters, which are applied across different regions of the input. 
    This greatly reduces the number of parameters compared to fully connected neural networks, making them more computationally efficient.
    Applications:
    CNNs are a cornerstone of many deep learning applications, including:
        Computer Vision: Image recognition, object detection, image segmentation, facial recognition.
        Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text classification, sentiment analysis.
        Medical Image Analysis: Disease detection and diagnosis from medical scans.

In essence, CNNs are a powerful and efficient architecture within the broader domain of deep learning, 
particularly adept at handling and extracting meaningful information from structured data like images.
