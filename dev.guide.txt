Main Courses for Computer Vision have Comments for begginers and Students.
UI Code is Clean by Naming Techniques so it does't need Comments.

For extending or changing ui.ui inside qtDesigner:

After change in qtDesigner run pyuic6 in terminal to convert the design to python code in qt6:
(you can load ui but then editing will be hard)

pyuic6 -x -o ./app2.py ./ui.ui
explanation:
pyuic6 > command
-x parameter > making it executable
-o parameter > taking path and name of output file, here app2.py 
   < Name of output file should be different than main file inside project to avoid overwrite >
ui.ui > .ui is an extension for qtdesigner files, help you to change UI easily and faster.

Ui_MainWindow in app2(new python code created by new design) should change as below:

#**************************************************************************
From old app.py(old design) copy codes between below and top symbole lines (these lines have a comment like this beside self: #*******************************)
#**************************************************************************
(There are 2 blocks: 1 block in setupUi function and 1 block in retranslateUi method). 

Now replace Ui_MainWindow class from app2(new) to app(old).
You can delete app2.py file because you have new design in your code.
