Main Courses for Computer Vision have Comments for begginers and Students.
UI Code is Clean by Naming Technique so it does't need Comments, for extending or changing ui.ui inside qtDesigner:

After change in designer run pyuic6 in terminal to convert the design to python code in qt6:
pyuic6 -x -o ./app2.py ./ui.ui
explanation:
pyuic6 > command
-x parameter > making it executable
-o parameter > taking path and name of output file, here app2.py 
   <Name of output file should be different than main file inside project 
    to transfer functional code from former design to the new design>
ui.ui > .ui is an extension for qtdesigner files, help you to change UI easily and faster.

delete entry point: | if __name__ == "__main__": | , optimized entry point will be added in below blocks

#<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Copy and Paste all codes inside (between) two lines same as above and below comment line from old app.py to new app2.py. 
#<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
(There are 2 blocks, one at Top other at Bottom)

Change or Copy from old app.py to new app2.py all lines with a comment like this beside: #*******************************
(There are 3 blocks marked between two # symboles that contain these code lines)

now you can delete or move old app.py and rename new app2.py to app.py, 
 now you have new added design + old functionality ready for adding
  new funtionality to new design.
