Main Courses for Computer Vision have Comments for begginers and Students.
UI Code is Clean by Naming Techniques so it does't need Comments.

For extending or changing ui.ui inside qtDesigner:

After change in qtDesigner run pyuic6 in terminal to convert the design to python code in qt6:
(you can load ui but then editing will be hard)

pyuic6 -x -o ./temporaryFile.py ./ui.ui
explanation:
pyuic6 > command
-x parameter > making it executable
-o parameter > taking path and name of output temporary File, here temporaryFile.py 
   < Name of output file should be different than python files inside project to avoid overwrite >
ui.ui > .ui is an extension for qtdesigner files, help you to change UI easily and faster.

Ui_MainWindow class in temporaryFile should change as below:

#**************************************************************************
From Ui_MainWindow class in old Ui_MainWindow.py in utilities folder copy codes between below and top symbole lines (these lines have a comment like this beside self: #*******************************)
#**************************************************************************
(There are 3 blocks: 2 blocks in setupUi function and 1 block in retranslateUi function). 
Replace same lines in Ui_MainWindow class in temporaryFile with copied files.

Now replace old Ui_MainWindow class inside Ui_MainWindow.py with new Ui_MainWindow class in temporaryFile.py.
You can delete aptemporaryFile.py file.
